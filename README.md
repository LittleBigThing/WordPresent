A WordPress presentation theme called WordPresent
===

Description
==

This theme enables making a presentation in WordPress using the Customizer.

Getting started
==

Start by uploading it to your WordPress (WP) site as usually with WP themes:

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

Set it up either by previewing the theme in the Customizer on a fresh WordPress install: this would allow you to see a predefined presentation as an example. You can change it before saving as you wish.

Otherwise:

1. Select or create a page; the title of the page is the title of the presentation, the content is anything you would like to appear on the first slide.
2. Use the page template "Presentation" before saving it.
3. Save and view the page and then go to the Customizer.
4. Go to widgets and the (only) widget area "Slides"
5. Add widgets, each widget is a presentation slide. Using a text widget gives you the most freedom in creating a slide, but other widgets work as well.

Good luck and enjoy!
